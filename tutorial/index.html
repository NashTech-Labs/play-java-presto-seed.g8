    <p> Presto is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running
        interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes
        ranging from gigabytes to petabytes.</p>
    <p> The seed application connects Play Application with Presto using JDBC</p>
    <p> The seed will allow user to connect to Presto, and the play application can query on big data.
    The scope of the application can be further extended for using other data bases as sources and allowing presto to
    query on these databases. This seed can be starting point to develop a big data application with Play Framework</p>
